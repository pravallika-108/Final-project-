To calculate the final result, first sum the individual values or scores obtained across all categories or components, and then divide this total by the maximum possible total for all categories to get a fraction. Multiply this fraction by 100 to express the performance as a percentage, which provides a clear snapshot of the overall achievement relative to the total available points or marks.
